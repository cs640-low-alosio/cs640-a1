Q2:
Expected:
The latency will be the sum of the latencies of L1, L2, and L3
plus a bit of propagation delay. Jared thinks the throughput will be an average
of each throughput L1, L2, and L3. Garrett thinks the throughput will be 
rate-limited  by the link with the least bandwidth.

Actual: 
The h1-h4 latency matched the sum of L1, L2, and L3 latency. Can't tell much
more because ping is not precise enough (only three digits).
The throughput was the rate-limiting bandwidth, in this case L1.

Q3:
Expected:
The total throughput between each pair of hosts will be divided by the number
of multiplexed hosts. If there are two pairs of hosts connected, then throughput
will be divided by two. Same for three, etc.
We predict no change to latency, because latency is independent of the number
of multiplexed hosts. It's a property of the links and switches.

Actual:
Latency did not change.
Throughput was not evenly divided between the host pairs, but it did approximately
add up to the throughput for one pair of hosts. We observed that the first host pair
to run got the highest throughput.

Two pairs
h1-h4
sent=39264 KB rate=15.706 Mbps
received=31384 KB rate=9.342 Mbps

h7-h9
sent=23798 KB rate=9.519 Mbps
received=23798 KB rate=7.190 Mbps

Three pairs
h1-h4
sent=31384 KB rate=12.554 Mbps
received=31384 KB rate=9.342 Mbps

h7-h9
sent=20734 KB rate=8.294 Mbps
received=20734 KB rate=5.890 Mbps

h8-h10
sent=14639 KB rate=5.856 Mbps
received=14639 KB rate=4.257 Mbps

Q4:
Expected:
We think the latency will be increased because of queuing delay. Compared to the 
previous question, traffic is being routed to and from different switches. 
We think the throughput will be affected similarly to Q3. The sum of the throughput
for the two host pairs will add up to the total throughput you would have with one
host pair connecting over L2.


Actual:
We saw that the latency was unaffected. Need to attend office hours and see if this
is being tested correctly.
We observed the latency decreased, but the sum added up to more than the L2 
throughput with one pair of hosts, unlike Q3.
